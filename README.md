# StreetBrawler

### Introduction

A street fighter clone using pure JavaScript. This project focuses on the diversity of JavaScript and uses Canvas elements for
the game play. To play the user must connect two Playstation controllers via USB to their device. The project uses the GamePad API. A user can
view the leaderboard from the main menu. This contains information of users that have won and is ranked by how many games they
have won. After starting a game a user can play against a friend. The X and O buttons are the action controls for PS4, and the 
directional pad controls movement. After a game has finished the player with the highest health wins and can record their score.

The project uses custom animations on the characters and when attack actions are fired, sound is also generated. This project was
a fun build and was interesting to see just how much can be achieved without the use of external libraries. The game play is buggy
but makes for a fun play.
